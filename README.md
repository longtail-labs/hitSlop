# hitSlop - Image Gen Playground

hitSlop is a small playground for experimenting with AI powered image tools on
top of React Flow.

* Connecting to OpenAI image generation and Google Gemini
* Supporting basic functionality like merging photos, tap anywhere to create a photo prompt

**Note:** You need to bring your own API keys (for now)


Check it out at hitslop.com

## Getting up and running

```bash
npm install # or `pnpm install` or `yarn install`
```

Vite is a great development server and build tool that we recommend our users to
use. You can start a development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

While the development server is running, changes you make to the code will be
automatically reflected in the browser!

## Todo

* Hook up Claude Code to PRs to automatically build features
* Hook up Claude Code PRs to shoot a message to Discord
* Users in Discord can launch the website from the PR and vote if it should be merged or not
* More functionality
